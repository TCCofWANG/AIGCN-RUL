# Aging-Informed Graph Convolutional Networks for Aero-Engine Health Prognosis

**AIGCN-RUL** (Aging-Informed Graph Convolutional Network for Remaining Useful Life Estimation) is a unified framework that formulates RUL prediction as an **aging-aware graph learning** problem. The method integrates degradation priors with dynamic inter-sensor dependencies using temporal embeddings and graph neural networks.

## Results

AIGCN-RUL is evaluated against 9 state-of-the-art baselines, including Dual-Mixer, DA-Transformer, FCSTGNN, and others.
Our method consistently outperforms all baselines on both C-MAPSS and N-CMAPSS datasets in terms of RMSE and Score.
